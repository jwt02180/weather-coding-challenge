This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

# Welcome!
My name is [Jameson Taylor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jameson-w-taylor/), and this repository is the result of completing a code challenge.

### Requirements
I was tasked with creating a weather app that satisfied the following criteria:
- Leverage [OpenWeatherAPI](https://openweathermap.org/api) to display a 5-day weather forecast in 3-hour increments for any specified US zip code.
- The app should use SSR, which each page displaying the forecast data.
- The project should use the URL structure /weather/[zip] to fetch and display weather data for any US zip code.
- Which framework I used was up to me to choose, but should includ Typescript.
- The UI design should be immediately intuitive and easy to navigate.
- Timebox this effort to only a few hours

### Extra credit
I wanted to take this opportunity to challenge myself and try using some things I was unfamiliar with, for which I decided to build this with the newer NextJS [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app) with [React Server Components](https://19.react.dev/reference/rsc/server-components#noun-labs-1201738-(2)).

### Final Thoughts
Thank you for taking the time to review my work, and I look forward to continuing onto the next step!

## Getting Started
